          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>In 2014 the total number of people who lacked healthcare by state and the total number living in poverty by state was positively and 
            significantly correlated (r=.957, n=51, p=.01). Poverty and obesity were also positively and 
            significanlty correlated (r=.986, n=51, p=.01).  There was no significant correlation between living in poverty
            and smoking.  In other words, states with higher rates of poverty also had higher rates of people without healthcare
            and higher rates of obesity but not smoking.</p>

          <p>In 2014 there was a very small but significant negative correlation between median age by state and percentage of people without healthcare (r=-.385, n=51, p=.01).  
            The older the mean age of the state population the lower the percentage of people in the state without healthcare. There was no significant correlation found 
            between median age by state and percentage of people with obesity.  There was no significant correlation found between median age by state and percentage of people with who smaoke. </p>

          <p>In 2014 there was a small but significant negative correlation between median income by state and percentage of people without healthcare (r=-.434, n=51, p=.01).  
            There is a small but significant correlation between median income by state and the percentage of people who are obese (r=-.651, n=51, p=.01).  The percentage of 
            people who smoked and the median income by state are significantly negatively correlated (r=-.660, n=51, p=.01).  This data demonstrates the higher the median 
            income the smaller the percentage of uninsured, obese, and smokers in a state. </p>
